My name is Gabriela Kadlecová and I am a 4th year PhD student at the Charles University in Prague. Currently, I am doing an internship in Amazon Alexa in Turin.

In my research, I focused on Neural architecture search,
specifically performance prediction, zero-cost proxies and graph neural network used as surrogate models. I also worked on the open-source library [whittle](https://github.com/whittle-org/whittle>) for LLM compression.
