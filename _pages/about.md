My name is Gabriela Kadlecová and I am a PhD student at Charles University in Prague. My research topic is [Neural architecture search](https://www.automl.org/nas-overview/),
specifically I focus on performance prediction, zero-cost proxies and graph neural network used as surrogate models.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, doing sports or playing board games. Other hobbies: 🐦 🏞️ :japan: 🎹
