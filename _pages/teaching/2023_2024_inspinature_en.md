# Nature inspired algorithms
Welcome to the webpage of practicals for the course Nature inspired algorithms [NAIL119](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=NAIL119)
taught in the summer semester 2023/2024! We meet at 10:40 in the SU1 classroom.

My mail `kadlecova -at- cs.cas.cz`, office hours upon agreement.
Here is the [link to the code](https://github.com/gabikadlecova/inspinature), and here is the [link to the lecture](https://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~pilat/en/nature-inspired-algorithms/) taught by Martin Pil√°t.

## Homework
Credit is given for solving three homeworks assigned during the semester. The homeworks will be assigned
at the exercises dedicated to the respective topic (they can be submitted earlier, which does not
necessarily mean earlier correction :-) ). The tasks are the same as for the other (Czech)
exercises.

Deadline for each homework is the evening after this exercise. The assignments are here:

- [Knapsack problem](/teaching/2023_2024_inspinature_hw1/) (Deadline 9th April 2024)
- [Reinforcement learning using neuroevolution](/teaching/2023_2024_inspinature_hw2/) (Deadline 14th May 2024)
- [Vehicle routing problem](/teaching/2023_2024_inspinature_hw2/) (Deadline 28th May 2024)

## Schedule
We will practice topics from the lecture. In addition, you can look forward to expanding topics such as
experimental design, or using wandb, tmux, and metacentrum for easier life during experiment processing.
If enough time, I will also show you how to create Python packages.
